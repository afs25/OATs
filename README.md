# OATs

OATs (Open Access Tools) is a collection of scripts to automate some of the tasks performed by the Open Access Team at the Office of Scholarly Communication, University of Cambridge. Documentation on how to install and use these tools is provided below.

## Dependencies

Scripts in the OATs package rely on external tools for most of their functionality, so the following software will need to be installed in your machine in order for OATs to work:

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org)
* [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive) or another LaTeX installation containing the TikZ package
* [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit) (a portable version of PDFtk for Windows is included in OATs, so Windows users can ignore this dependency)
